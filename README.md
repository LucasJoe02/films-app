# Films App
This project is the React front end for a full stack dynamic webapp for searching a database of films 
and interacting with those films such as commenting and rating. Unfortunately the back-end of the webapp 
was too integrated with my university's database system so is not hosted here and thus this app is more 
of a proof of understanding as opposed to a full working webapp.

## Running Locally

1. Use `npm install` to populate the `node_modules/` directory with up-to-date packages.
2. Run `npm start` to start the webapp.
3. The server will be accessible on `localhost:8080`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
